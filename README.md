FlickrFollowr
=============

Small python app that keeps track of who I'm following on Flickr, and suggests new contacts to me on a regular basis. 

This is a very early stage version that I'm working on. 
I'll be updating here as complete it. 

I'm creating a very basic tool that will use the Flickr API to pull in a list of people who are followed by photographers I consider good curators and connectors. 

With that list, I'll have the application provide me with a daily digest of half a dozen or so photographers to consider following and a dozen or so of their photos to consider favoriting/reposing. 

Currently uses SQLite 3. 
Future build includes flask for web development and possibly email functionality.
